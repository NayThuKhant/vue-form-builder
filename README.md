### SASS Variables

In case you'd like to customize the layout variables, open **\_variables.scss** file under src/layout folder. The list is pretty short as majority of the variables are derived from the PrimeVue theme being used.

**src/assets/\_variables.scss**

```css
$fontSize: 1rem;
$borderRadius: 12px;
$transitionDuration: 0.2s;
```
